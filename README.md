# portfolio-generator

## Purpose
In this project we will dynamicly create a website that shows a users info and lists projets the user has accomplished. We are able to achieve this using node.js and the inquirer npm package which will prompt the user through the commant line. The user will be prompted for user information and portfolio data. After a series of questions and user input the program will generate a index.html file filled with the information the user gave in the prompts.
